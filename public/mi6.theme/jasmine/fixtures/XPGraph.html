I've had to jump in and dig through hundreds of lines of poorly structured JavaScript more times than I can remember, when I hop on a project built on Backbone there's a comfort in already knowing how the project is structured and how to keep it in good shape.&quot;}">

The super-power isn't about the belt, but it makes a lot of stuff much easier.&quot;}">

I get to adhere to a programmatical mindset as opposed to just writing declarations, which makes writing styles really enjoyable, especially with tools like Compass or Bourbon.&quot;}">

If breakpoints doesn't give the right experience or feel intuitive enough - then there a lot of room for improvements. Truly responsive applications that feels right from phone to desktop, that just gives a really professional impression.&quot;}">
