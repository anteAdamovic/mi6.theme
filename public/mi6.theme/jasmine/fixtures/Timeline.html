                Nakademin's Interactions Design program consists in four primary sections - In-depth Software education, Design &amp; Marketing strategics, Modern Web Technology,  and Business preparation/acclimatization (LIA, internship).<br><br>

                          Each cornerstone being divided into sub-sections were substantial and fruitful but the section of Modern Web Technology was well emphasized. This is where subjects like UX, UI Design, Study of MMI and the Study of Interaction Design were handled, apart from the regular mandatory web technology studies.<br><br>

                          Each year was finished with a 6-10 week internship as to prepare and align the student to the current market.
